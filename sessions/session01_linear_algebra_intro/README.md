# Session 1 — Introduction to Linear Algebra

**Duration:** 90–120 minutes  
**Prerequisites:** Basic algebra, high-school vectors helpful but not required.  
**Session topics:**  
- Linear algebra overview & applications  
- Vector properties and operations  
- Linear independence & span  
- Change of basis (vectors)  
- Matrix introduction & types of matrices

This session is self-contained: lecture notes, slide deck (markdown), notebooks with runnable code, exercises, autograder tests, instructor solutions, a small dataset, and a mini-project starter notebook.

Folder structure:
- 00_lecture/ — slides + lecture_notes.md
- 01_notebooks/ — detailed notebooks (vectors, vector spaces, projections/least-squares)
- 02_exercises/ — theory problems + coding problems
- 03_autograder/ — pytest tests for coding exercises
- 04_datasets/ — small example datasets for labs
- 05_mini_project/ — project prompt + starter notebook
- 06_instructor/ — solutions & learning plan
- meta.yml — session metadata
