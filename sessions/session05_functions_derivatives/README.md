# Session 5 — Functions, Differentiation, Multivariate Calculus

**Session learning outcomes**:
- Define single- and multi-variable functions and compute derivatives
- Compute gradients, Jacobians, and Hessians where appropriate
- Use derivatives to reason about optimization problems

## Notebooks (with short descriptions)
- `01_single_variable_derivatives.ipynb` — Rules of differentiation, symbolic examples, numeric checks.
- `02_multivariable_gradients.ipynb` — Gradient, directional derivative, chain rule, Jacobian matrices.
- `03_hessians_and_quadratic_forms.ipynb` — Second derivatives, Hessian tests for extrema.

## Exercises
- `derivatives_problems.md` — Compute derivatives by hand; verify with autograd (optional).
- `gradient_lab.ipynb` — Implement gradient checks and finite-difference approximations.

## Mini-project
- `symbolic_derivation_examples.ipynb` — Derive gradients for logistic loss and MSE; implement numerical gradient checker.
