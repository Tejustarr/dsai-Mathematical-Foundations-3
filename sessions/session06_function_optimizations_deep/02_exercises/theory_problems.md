# Theory Problems — Session 6

1. For f(x)=x^4-2x^2, find critical points and classify with second derivative test.
2. Show that if f is convex and differentiable, then f(y) ≥ f(x)+∇f(x)·(y-x).
3. Prove convergence rate of gradient descent on strongly convex quadratic with step size α < 2/L.
4. Discuss trade-offs between batch GD and SGD.
