# dsai-Mathematical-Foundations-2

Deep, community-standard course materials for Mathematical Foundations for Data Science.

**Learning outcomes (course-level)**:
- Understand linear algebra fundamentals used in data science.
- Represent and manipulate data as vectors and matrices.
- Compute eigenvalues/eigenvectors, SVD/PCA for dimensionality reduction.
- Differentiate functions and apply optimization algorithms (GD/SGD).
- Build simple ML models from first principles using math + numpy.

Repo structure follows community standards: lectures (theory), sessions (deep hands-on modules), resources, assignments, quizzes, instructor_materials, and tooling (autograder skeleton).
