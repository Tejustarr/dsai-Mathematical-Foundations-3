# Theory Problems â€” Session 1

1. (Span & basis) Let v1 = [1,2,3]^T, v2 = [2,4,6]^T, v3 = [0,1,1]^T in R^3.
   a) Show whether {v1,v2,v3} is linearly independent.
   b) Find a basis for span{v1,v2,v3} and its dimension.

2. (Change of basis) Given basis B = {b1=[1,1]^T, b2=[1,-1]^T} in R^2.
   a) Find coordinates of x=[3,0]^T in basis B.
   b) Provide change-of-basis matrix from B to standard basis.

3. (Projection) Prove that the projection matrix P = A(A^T A)^{-1}A^T is symmetric and idempotent (P^2 = P).

4. (Matrix types) Give an example of a 3x3 orthogonal matrix that is not diagonal. Verify Q^T Q = I.
