# Session 1 — Introduction to Linear Algebra

**Session learning outcomes**:
- Represent vectors and matrices; implement them in numpy
- Compute inner products, norms, and projections
- Understand span, basis, linear independence

## Notebooks (with short descriptions)
- `01_vectors_numpy.ipynb` — Vectors as arrays, broadcasting, dot product, norms, geometric interpretation.
- `02_vector_spaces_basis_span.ipynb` — Span, basis, dimension, examples, small proofs.
- `03_inner_products_projections.ipynb` — Inner products, norms, Cauchy-Schwarz, projection onto subspace, least squares intro.
- `04_matrix_basics_rank_nullspace.ipynb` — Matrix as linear map, row/column space, rank, nullspace, solving Ax=0.

## Exercises
- `theory_problems.md` — Proofs: show linear independence, compute basis for given sets, true/false concept checks.
- `coding_problems.ipynb` — Implement projection, check orthogonality, compute rank and nullspace with numpy/scipy.

## Mini-project
- `vector_geometry_case.ipynb` — Use linear algebra to analyze and visualize transformations of 2D shapes (rotation/scaling/shear) — include derivations and numpy code.

## Sample problems
- Given vectors v1,v2,v3 in R^4 determine if they are independent and find a basis for their span.
- Project a point onto a plane given by two basis vectors; show derivation and implement in numpy.
