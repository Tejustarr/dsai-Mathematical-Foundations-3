# Mini-Project: GD vs SGD for Logistic Regression

Dataset: synthetic binary classification.
1. Implement logistic regression model and loss.
2. Implement batch gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent.
3. Compare convergence (loss vs epochs), runtime, and accuracy.
4. Experiment with learning rates and schedules.
5. Visualize decision boundaries.

Deliverables: `project_notebook.ipynb`, report.md.
