# Mini-Project: 2D Transformation Visualizer

**Goal:** Build a small notebook that demonstrates linear transformations (rotation, scaling, shear, reflection) applied to a 2D point-set. Provide:
- Mathematical derivation of each transformation matrix.
- Implementations in numpy that apply transformations to points.
- Visualization before & after (matplotlib).
- An experiment: start with a shape (e.g., polygon), apply sequence of transforms, and show combined matrix equals product of matrices.
- Short report (1-2 pages) describing results and any numerical issues.

**Deliverables:**
- `visualizer.ipynb` (runnable)
- `report.pdf` (or markdown)
- `README.md` explaining how to run
