# Session 4 — PCA, SVD, Matrix Factorization, Image Compression

**Session learning outcomes**:
- Compute covariance matrix and perform PCA for dimensionality reduction
- Understand Singular Value Decomposition and its connection to PCA
- Apply SVD to image compression and interpret low-rank approximations

## Notebooks (with short descriptions)
- `01_covariance_pca.ipynb` — Covariance, eigen-decomposition of covariance, PCA projections & reconstruction.
- `02_svd_theory.ipynb` — SVD theorem, properties, relation to rank and subspaces.
- `03_svd_image_compression.ipynb` — Implement image compression via truncated SVD; measure error & storage tradeoff.

## Exercises
- `pca_quiz.md` — Hands-on PCA exercises and conceptual questions.
- `svd_lab.ipynb` — Experiment with different ranks and visualize reconstruction errors.

## Mini-project
- `face_recognition_pca.ipynb` — Build a simple face-recognition baseline using PCA as feature extractor (eigenfaces).
