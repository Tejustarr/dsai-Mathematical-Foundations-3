# Session 2 â€” Linear Transformations

**Duration:** 120 minutes  
**Prerequisites:** Session 1 (vectors, matrices, linear independence, span, projection).  

**Topics:**
- Basic matrix transformations (rotation, scaling, reflection, shear)
- Determinant (definition, properties, geometric meaning)
- Matrix inverse (definition, computation)
- Determinant and inverse for special matrices (triangular, diagonal, orthogonal)
- Orthogonal matrices & Gram-Schmidt process (QR decomposition)
- Eigenvalues and eigenvectors (definition, computation)
- Eigenbasis and transformations (diagonalization)

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Understand geometric meaning of transformations and determinants
- Compute inverses and determinants, especially for special cases
- Orthogonalize a basis using Gram-Schmidt
- Derive and compute eigenvalues/eigenvectors and understand diagonalization
