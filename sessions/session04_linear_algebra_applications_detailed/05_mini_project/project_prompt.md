# Mini-Project: Face Image Compression with SVD

Dataset: small set of face images (grayscale).
1. Load images, convert to grayscale.
2. Apply SVD to each.
3. Keep top k singular values (k=10,20,50).
4. Reconstruct images and compare with originals.
5. Plot compression ratio vs reconstruction error.

Deliverables: project.ipynb, report.md.
