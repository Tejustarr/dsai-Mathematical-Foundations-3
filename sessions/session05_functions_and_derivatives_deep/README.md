# Session 5 â€” Functions & Derivatives (Deep)

**Duration:** 180 minutes (can be split across two classes)  
**Prerequisites:** Multivariable calculus basics (recommended), Sessions 1-4.  

**Topics covered (very deeply):**
- Function definition and representation (explicit, implicit, parametric)
- Linear vs non-linear functions and examples
- Single-variable and multivariable functions; domain, codomain
- Differentiation: rules, chain/product/quotient, implicit differentiation
- Partial derivatives, gradient, directional derivatives
- Jacobian and Hessian matrices; properties and applications
- Numerical differentiation: finite differences and gradient checking
- Integration basics (definite/indefinite) and the fundamental theorem of calculus
- Worked examples, symbolic derivations, and coding labs
