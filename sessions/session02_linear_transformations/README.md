# Session 2 — Linear Transformations, Determinants, Inverses, Orthogonality, Eigen

**Session learning outcomes**:
- Interpret matrices as linear transformations and change-of-basis
- Compute determinants and inverses, understand geometric meaning
- Perform Gram-Schmidt and identify orthogonal matrices
- Compute eigenvalues/eigenvectors and diagonalization when possible

## Notebooks (with short descriptions)
- `01_linear_maps_change_of_basis.ipynb` — Change of basis matrices, similarity transforms, coordinates.
- `02_determinants_and_geometry.ipynb` — Determinant properties, volume interpretation, computation.
- `03_matrix_inverse_and_special_matrices.ipynb` — Inverse computation, singular matrices, triangular matrices.
- `04_gram_schmidt_orthogonality.ipynb` — GS process, QR factorization, numerical stability.
- `05_eigen_decomposition.ipynb` — Eigenvalues, eigenvectors, diagonalization, defective matrices.

## Exercises
- `eigen_theory.md` — Compute eigenpairs, show proofs about diagonalizability, compute change-of-basis.
- `coding_lab.ipynb` — Implement power method, QR algorithm (basic), and compare numpy.linalg.eig results.

## Mini-project
- `eigen_image_transform.ipynb` — Use eigen-decomposition for image filtering or understanding PCA directions in small images.
