# Theory Problems â€” Session 5

1. Prove the product and chain rules starting from the limit definition of derivative.
2. Given f(x,y)=x^2 y + e^{xy}, compute gradient and Hessian; classify critical points where gradient=0 if any.
3. Derive derivative of determinant function g(A)=det(A) with respect to entries of A (hint: use Jacobi's formula).
4. Show that if f is differentiable, then directional derivative equals dot(grad f, u).
5. Explain why central difference has error O(h^2) while forward difference is O(h).
