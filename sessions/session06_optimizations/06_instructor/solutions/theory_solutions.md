# Theory Solutions
1. f(x)=x^4-2x^2: f'=4x^3-4x=4x(x^2-1). Critical points x=0,±1. f''=12x^2-4. At 0, f''=-4 (max). At ±1, f''=8 (min).
2. Convexity inequality is equivalent to subgradient property. Prove using definition.
3. Convergence rate: for strongly convex with condition number κ, GD error decreases like (1-αμ)^k.
4. Batch vs SGD: batch stable but expensive, SGD noisy but scalable.
