# Session 3 — Linear Algebra for Machine Learning

**Duration:** 120–150 minutes  
**Prerequisites:** Session 1 (linear algebra basics), Session 2 (eigen, transformations).  

**Topics:**
- Mathematical modeling of ML problems
  - Linear regression overview
  - Problem formulation
  - Explanation through an example
- Image pre-processing
  - Image basics (pixels, representation)
  - Linear transformations
  - Filtering (convolution)

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Formulate linear regression as a linear algebra problem
- Derive the normal equations and closed-form solution
- Understand image representation as matrices
- Apply linear transformations and filters to images
- Connect linear algebra to core ML and CV tasks
